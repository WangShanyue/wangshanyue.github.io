1. **Ultra-Low-Power Massive IoT Platform**

<!-- ![Ultra-Low-Power Massive IoT Platform](../images/Massive.jpg) -->

   - An optimal spectrum planning strategy based on linear programming enables 30 tags to communicate concurrently in a 630kHz band with 305kbps throughput. A conflict-tolerant priority scheduling technique supports 96-tag cooperation.
   - For high-bandwidth WiFi backscatter signals, partial spectrum overlap and interference cancellation enable concurrent communication of 10 tags in the 2.4GHz band.
   - Design large-scale backscatter communication protocols, combine spatial pseudo-orthogonality and OFDMA techniques to enable simulation of 9,600 tags concurrency.
