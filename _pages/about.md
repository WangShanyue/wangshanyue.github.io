RESEARCH PLATFORMS
======
1. **Ultra-Low-Power Massive IoT Platform**
   - An optimal spectrum planning strategy based on linear programming enables 30 tags to communicate concurrently in a 630kHz band with 305kbps throughput. A conflict-tolerant priority scheduling technique supports 96-tag cooperation.
   - For high-bandwidth WiFi backscatter signals, partial spectrum overlap and interference cancellation enable concurrent communication of 10 tags in the 2.4GHz band.
   - Design large-scale backscatter communication protocols, combine spatial pseudo-orthogonality and OFDMA techniques to enable simulation of 9,600 tags concurrency.

2. **Robust Battery-Free Sensors Platform**
   - **Robust Sensing Platform Based on Ambient WiFi Backscatter**: Restores the original frequency band using WiFi pilot signals for single-receiver demodulation and recovers corrupted signals by detecting interference-free subcarriers, reducing FER by up to 50%.
   - **Wide-Range Passive Universal Sensing Platform**: Utilizing MOSFET transistors combined with an ultra-low-power square wave reference circuit to establish a stable relationship between RF signal parameters and sensor voltage. The prototype operates within 30 µW, with an average measurement error of less than 3%.
